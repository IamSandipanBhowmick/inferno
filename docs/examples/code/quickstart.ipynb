Inferno represents these as boolean tensors, typically where samples over the first dimension indicate the spikes at each time step. Most commonly this is done by representing spike generation as a Poisson point process. The intervals between spikes follow an exponential distribution with a mean equal to the expected frequency. More on Poisson spike generation can be found in this [excellent write-up](https://github.com/btel/python-in-neuroscience-tutorials/blob/master/poisson_process.ipynb)."
