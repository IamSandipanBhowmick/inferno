This example goes over building a machine learning model with Inferno and creating an end-to-end pipeline for training and inference. It covers some basic concepts which arise when developing with Inferno, and is a good place to get started.

This example compares how ([STDP](<zoo/learning-stdp:Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP)>)), modulated spike-timing dependent plasticity ([MSTDP](<zoo/learning-stdp:Modulated Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (MSTDP)>)), and modulated spike-timing dependent plasticity with eligibility trace ([MSTDPET](<zoo/learning-stdp:Modulated Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity with Eligibility Trace (MSTDPET)>)) update connection weights.
